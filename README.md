*zero-js* is a lightframe, tiny framework, made by developers, for developers.

## Features: 
  - Supports plain old javascript.
  - No webpack, babel, or gulp needed.
  - Runs natively in the browser.

## Getting Started:
Currently, the best way to begin using *zero-js* is by adding the script in your document, by using defer, to ensure the webpage loads properly before loading your javascript
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/smitec/zero-js/blob/master/zero.js" defer></script>
```
Alternatively, we can use asynchronous.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://github.com/smitec/zero-js/blob/master/zero.js" async></script>
```
